# Onion Search Engine - Public Frontend


## üõ°Ô∏è About This Repository

This repository contains the **complete open-source code for the public-facing frontend of Onion Search Engine**.

Onion Search Engine is an independent platform dedicated to making anonymous networks like the Tor network accessible and safe. We operate on an **"Open Core" model**. We have open-sourced this frontend as a verifiable commitment to our core principles: **a strict no-log and no-tracking privacy policy**.

By making our user-facing code public, anyone can audit our platform to confirm that we do not collect, store, or share user search queries.

Please note that our backend crawlers, indexers, proprietary ranking algorithms, and the professional threat intelligence platform remain closed-source.
